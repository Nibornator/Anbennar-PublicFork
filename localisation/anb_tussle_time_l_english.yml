 tussle_time.1.t:0 "Something on the Wind"
 tussle_time.1.d:0 "The world turns, across Halann the people live as they always have. But something seems off in the air itself and none can quite say how or why. Something queer is afoot and yet the feeling always passes even when the curious attempt to divine more.\n\nFrom across ruined Aelantir, divided Cannor, sundered Bulwar, scattered Sarhal and the halls of Haless there are strange events and the people are a tad more restless as a result."
 tussle_time.1.a:0 "Words are wind, these ideas are of no concern to me."
 tussle_time.2.t:0 "An Awakening Felt"
 tussle_time.2.d:0 "News comes quickly to our court. Criers across the land hark this word.\n\nThe land has been scorched, across what we know of Halann we have heard of this happening at a few seemingly random sites. The ground is scorched and the air reeks of acrid sulfur. Brimstone has been found at these places in ways it out not to have been. Fires rage on longer than they ought to have fuel for and burn a sickly green when at the peak of their heat instead of the normal purifying white.\n\nThese places are cursed, perhaps even marked. The presence of the Infernal seems impossible to ignore. What comes next is beyond the sight of our diviners and in these dark times it seems all we can do but to be watchful and prepare for the worst when hell is let loose."
 tussle_time.2.a:0 "A pox upon all our houses in this dark hour."
